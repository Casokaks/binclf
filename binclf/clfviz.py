    # The decision estimator has an attribute called tree_  which stores the entire
    # tree structure and allows access to low level attributes. The binary tree
    # tree_ is represented as a number of parallel arrays. The i-th element of each
    # array holds information about the node `i`. Node 0 is the tree's root. NOTE:
    # Some of the arrays only apply to either leaves or split nodes, resp. In this
    # case the values of nodes of the other type are arbitrary!
    #
    # Among those arrays, we have:
    #   - left_child, id of the left child of the node
    #   - right_child, id of the right child of the node
    #   - feature, feature used for splitting the node
    #   - threshold, threshold value at the node
    #
    
    # Using those arrays, we can parse the tree structure:
